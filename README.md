## The leader-follower mission using UB-ANC Agent template
The follower mission is an example that shows how to use UB-ANC Agent to develop new mission. In this mission, MAV `i + 1` follows 10 meters behind MAV `i`. This is accomplished by MAV `i` sending its GPS location to MAV `i + 1` every 100 ms using a 74 byte packet.
